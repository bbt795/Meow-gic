You play as Nyarlathotep Igor Phantom Eternal Darkness Abracadabra Alakazam Ichabod II (a.k.a. Nya), a cat wizard who lives in a small village with his best friends. One day, as Nya awoke from a cat nap, he noticed that something was... off... 

THERE WAS AN EXTRA DIMENSION! Their fun, little 2D town was now fully 3D!!! Now, while Nya didn't particularly mind the extra dimension, it was definitely a problem for the other villagers. So, it's up to Nya to figure out where this extra dimension is coming from and put a stop to it!

In this rogue-lite, play as a funny cat wizard who scoures the forest in search of a reason why his 2D village is suddenly 3D! Defeat difficult enemies throughout the forest to earn money and potentially reach the final boss! Don't worry though, cats have 9 lives, so you get 9 attempts at defeating the evil force behind this extra dimension!
