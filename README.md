You play as Nyarlathotep Igor Phantom Eternal Darkness Abracadabra Alakazam Ichabod II (a.k.a. Nya), a cat wizard who lives in a small village with his best friends. One day, as Nya awoke from a cat nap, he noticed that something was... off... 

THERE WAS AN EXTRA DIMENSION! Their fun, little 2D town was now fully 3D!!! Now, while Nya didn't particularly mind the extra dimension, it was definitely a problem for the other villagers. So, it's up to Nya to figure out where this extra dimension is coming from and put a stop to it!
